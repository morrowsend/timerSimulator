# Microcontroller PWM Timer Simulator

This repo have a few examples showing how the timer in a microcontroller works graphically.

There are two sets: One where you can adjust the Compare Value like a rel microcontroller, and one where you adjust the duty cycle directly.

My recommendation is to start use the set CMP Value Vertical.p5js file.

Once running in the P5.js editor, click on the app pane and control values with keypresses. the outputs of these are shown on the console

Key commands are as follows:
- W or w = Increases the maximum waveform Frequency
- S or s = Decreases the maximum waveform Frequency
- O or o = Descrease prescaler (only values 1, 2, 4)
- P or p = Increase prescaler (only values 1, 2, 4)
- N or n = Decrease compare value (or duty cycle)
- M or m = increase Compare value (or duty cycle)
